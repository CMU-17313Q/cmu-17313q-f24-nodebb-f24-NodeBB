I integrated the NodeJsscan static tool to check for security issues when needed. 
Since it is a python build tool, I was not able to integrate it automatically to the 
workflow. 
So to use it you have to install locally by running 'pip install njsscan' on your terminal.
After the tool is install run 'njsscan' to start using it.
You can test the security of a file by running 'njsscan <filepath>' on your terminal!

Here is a link to the tool documentation: https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan#command-line-options
